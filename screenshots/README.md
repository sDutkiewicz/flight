# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory should contain screenshots of your BPMN Process Editor application.

Replace these placeholder instructions with actual screenshots:

1. **bpmn-editor.png**: Main application view showing the editor interface
2. **editor-interface.png**: Close-up of the editing canvas with a process diagram
3. **system-data-management.png**: The systems and data management panel
4. **export-options.png**: Export dialog showing the available options

## How to take screenshots

1. Run the application with `npm run dev` from the bpmn-app directory
2. Navigate to the browser and open the running application
3. Use browser tools or screenshot software to capture the application
4. Save the images in this directory with the filenames mentioned above

Remember to crop screenshots to focus on relevant parts of the application and maintain consistent dimensions (suggested: 1280Ã—720 pixels).
