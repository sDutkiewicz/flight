This tool allows you to create, edit, and export BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams with a focus on flight operations, airport management, and related systems.

## Purpose & Applications

### For Aviation Operations
This editor helps aviation operations teams document and optimize critical workflows such as:
- Aircraft turnaround processes
- Passenger boarding and deplaning procedures
- Baggage handling operations
- Flight dispatch and preparation sequences
- Crew management and assignment workflows
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking

### For IT & Systems Integration
The system tagging feature allows IT teams and system architects to:
- Map which aviation systems (DCS, BHS, CRM, etc.) are involved in each process step
- Document data flows between different airport systems
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Plan system upgrades with clear visualization of process impacts
- Track which data entities (Passenger, Flight, Baggage, etc.) are processed at each step

### For Compliance & Training
Process documentation created with this tool supports:
- Regulatory compliance documentation for aviation authorities
- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) development
- Training material creation for ground staff and flight crew
- Process auditing and optimization
- Safety management system documentation

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0.0 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sDutkiewicz/flight.git
   cd flight/bpmn-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
   (or the port shown in your terminal)

## üß∞ Usage Guide

### Creating a New Diagram

1. Click on "New" to start with a blank diagram, or
2. Click on "Templates" to choose a pre-configured template

### Adding Elements

- Use the BPMN palette on the left side to add elements to your diagram
- Click on an element type and then click on the canvas to place it
- Connect elements by clicking and dragging from one element to another

### Tagging Tasks with Systems and Data

1. Click on a task in your diagram
2. Open the Systems/Data panel by clicking the "Systems & Data" button
3. Click on a system or data entity to tag the selected task
4. Tagged tasks will show the system/data references

### Filtering Elements

1. Use the dropdown selectors in the toolbar to filter elements by system or data entity
2. Only elements tagged with the selected system/data will remain visible
3. Click "Clear" to reset filters and show all elements

### Saving and Exporting

1. Click the "Save" button to download your diagram as a BPMN XML file
2. Click "Export" to access additional export options:
   - SVG: Vector graphics suitable for presentations
   - PNG: Raster image format
   - PDF: Document format with additional options

## üß™ Development Notes

### Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `App.jsx`: Main application component
  - `BpmnEditorClean.jsx`: Core editor implementation
  - `assets/`: Static assets and icons
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `data/`: Default data and templates
  - `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled files will be located in the `dist/` directory.

## ÔøΩ Technical Implementation Details

### System Architecture

The Flight BPMN Process Editor is built as a single-page application (SPA) using modern web technologies. The architecture focuses on:

1. **Front-End Only Operation**: The application runs entirely in the browser with no backend dependencies, making it easy to deploy and use without complex infrastructure.

2. **Modular Component Design**: The editor is composed of reusable React components that handle specific aspects of functionality:
   - BPMN modeling canvas
   - System and data entity management
   - Export functionality
   - Template library

3. **Persistent Storage**: The application uses browser localStorage to save:
   - System catalog definitions
   - Data entity definitions
   - Current diagram state
   - User preferences

### Key Technical Features

#### System Tagging Mechanism
The editor extends the standard BPMN format with custom properties:
- `systemTags`: Associates tasks with aviation/airport systems
- `dataTags`: Links tasks with specific data entities being processed

This tagging system enables:
- Filtering diagram elements based on system or data entity
- Understanding cross-system processes and data flows
- Identifying which systems are involved in different process steps

#### Visual Task Filtering
Tasks can be filtered by:
- Associated system (e.g., only show tasks involving the Departure Control System)
- Data entity (e.g., only show tasks that process Passenger data)

#### Integration Capabilities
The exported BPMN XML files:
- Maintain compatibility with standard BPMN tools
- Include custom extensions for aviation-specific metadata
- Can be imported back into the editor for further editing

## üìà Use Cases & Workflows

### Process Documentation Workflow
1. **Create** a new BPMN diagram or start from a template
2. **Model** the operational process with appropriate BPMN elements
3. **Tag** tasks with relevant systems and data entities
4. **Document** additional details using annotations and text
5. **Export** as BPMN XML for storage in documentation systems
6. **Share** as PDF or images for presentations and reporting

### System Integration Analysis
1. **Model** the end-to-end process spanning multiple systems
2. **Tag** each task with the system that performs it
3. **Filter** by system to see each system's responsibilities
4. **Identify** integration points between systems
5. **Document** data exchange requirements at integration points

### Process Improvement Cycle
1. **Document** the current state process ("as-is")
2. **Analyze** inefficiencies and bottlenecks
3. **Design** improved process flows ("to-be")
4. **Compare** current and future states
5. **Implement** changes with clear documentation
6. **Monitor** process performance after changes
